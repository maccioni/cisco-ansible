# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]

#inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts
inventory = ./hosts

# disable host checking to automatically add hosts to known_hosts
host_key_checking = False

# set the roles path to the local directory
roles_path     = ./

# default user to use for playbooks if user is not specified
# (/usr/bin/ansible will use current user as default)
remote_user = admin
